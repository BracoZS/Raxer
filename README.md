Raxer is an application designed to **customize and/or remap mouse buttons** according to your needs, including:
- Left click
- Right click
- Wheel/middle click
- Side button 4 
- Side button 5

If you want to remap any button, assign new functions, or fix incorrect configurations, Raxer is the ideal tool.

<details>
<summary>⏳ Short History</summary>
I made this application to solve a problem I had 😅: fixing my mouse side buttons because they came incorrectly configured from the factory (reversed).  
Now, it has evolved to customize many more mice out there!

## ❓ How to Use
1. Download the .zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/BracoZS/Raxer/releases) section and extract it.  
2. Run the .exe file inside the folder. The application will start, and an icon will appear in the system tray.
3. Go to the **Profiles** section and start configuring your mouse.

If you click on the system tray icon, you will see a menu with three options:
   - **Open settings**: Opens the settings window where you can make changes.
   - **Suspend**: The app enters an inactive state, and the mouse returns to its native behavior until reactivated. Your settings remain saved.  
     This menu option changes to **Activate** to resume functionality.
   - **Exit**: Closes the application.
